This is a notice that **module-loader** in the kernel host is no longer used - why?

Because the Initializer (Initor) module is used for loading kernel-modules. Until the
kernel itself is able to load more file from disk - there is no use of getting the
kernel module loader fixed.

What fixes are required?

The Initor module passes a global symbol table having all the kernel module symbols in
a centralized hash - which allows fast lookup. Before the Initor was created, the ModuleLoader
used the SymbolLookup class to store the boot-time kernel module symbols.
