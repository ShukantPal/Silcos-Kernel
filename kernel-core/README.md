# Kernel Core

This is the core part of the Silcos kernel infrastructure. It handles the most trusted portion of the kernel functionality, which includes module-handling, memory management and task management. The kernel-core project has been divded into modules (like KernelHost), each of which have a separae bulid process. They are each bundled into a shared library (ELF shared library).

The Initor module (written in only C), is a special module bundled in a executable, which loads the other modules (with the help of a multiboot bootloader, like GRUB). This is because Silcos kernel (will) supports dynamic symbol formation, and bootloaders cannot support the sophisticated linking requirements of kernel modules. This has the side effect of pushing the warning of missing symbols (when you type the wrong function name) into runtime, when the Initor module fails to locate a symbol.s
