# EarlyInitRace

This is a condition where the KernelHost global-namespace objects have a `default` constructor to initialize themselves with zeros, just for sanity. This may actually cause catastrophic problems if, they are used before the `InitAllObjects` function is called by `Main()`. To provide basic services like `Console`, `kmalloc`, `physical/virtual memory` to the constructors, these must be initialized beforehand. As they themselves are also built in C++, they internally use C++ constructors. But these are initialized using `placement new` before `InitAllObjects`, and the default constructor is executed after they are already built. If this `default` constructor, zeros out the object, it will be useless. Therefore, early-init object constructors must not do anything to the object and any warning (by an IDE) must be suppressed.
